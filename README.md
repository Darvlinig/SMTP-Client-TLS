# SMTP-Client-TLS

This program allows user to send simple emails (plain text) using the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).
TLS (STARTTLS) connection is supported.

When using this with Gmail, you may find it useful to create an app-specific password. You may also need to enable "Less secure apps", but try it without doing that first.
